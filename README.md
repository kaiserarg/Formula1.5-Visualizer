# Formula 1.5 Visualizer

Inspired by [r/Formula1Point5](https://www.reddit.com/r/Formula1Point5/) on Reddit, this website is made to automate the process of tallying points and statistics for Formula 1.5.

From the subreddit, the whole purpose of Formula 1.5 is to:
>celebrate the capable drivers and teams part of the Formula 1 midfield, who maybe do not get the recognition and visibility they deserve.
